            <p>shattering cookware</p>
            <p>
              more than 37,000 people were injured from using cookware.
              <span>hot</span> handles can burn and sometimes glass cookware can
              shatter.

            <p>knife cuts</p>
            <p>
              lacerations caused by knives of all kinds (not just the kitchen
              type) affected more than 350,000 people in 2012, according to the
              <span>consumer product safety commission. dull</span> knives are
              actually more dangerous than sharp ones, because they require more
              pressure to use and their worn edge can cause the knife to slip
              off food and into your fingers.

              the oven is magic. <span>no</span> longer do we have to sear our
              food on an open fire like our ancestors did; we have a nifty box
              that keeps the heat contained and cooks our food to perfection.
              <span>but</span> all that heat combined with metal components and
              cookware leads to loads of burns. <span>quick</span> tips (which
              are obvious, but good to keep in mind): <span>always</span> use
              oven mitts, replace them when they’re old; don’t use a wet towel
              as an oven mitt; don’t reach your arm in to check baked goods,
              pull out the rack to test;

              more than 10,000 people were hurt using microwaves.

            <p>
              fires involving cooking equipment account for two of every five
              reported home fires. <span>unattended</span> cooking equipment
              accounts for one in three fires, and half are ignited by fat,
              grease, oil, or related substances, according to the

            <p>
              the most insidious of all dangers, perhaps, are the germs lurking
              in your food. <span>the centers</span> for
              <span>disease control</span> and <span>Prevention</span>
              <span class="to-upper-case">(CDC)</span>
              estimates that each year roughly one in six
              <span>americans</span> (or 48 million people) gets sick, 128,000
              are hospitalized, and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases.
              <span>the</span> top five culprits sending
              <span>americans</span> to the hospital are salmonella, norovirus,
              <span>campylobacter</span> spp., <span>toxoplasma</span> gondii
              and <span>e.coli</span> – but much can be done in terms of proper
              food handling, cooking and storage to help prevent these pathogens
              from causing illness.
